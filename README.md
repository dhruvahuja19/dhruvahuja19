### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ I'm currently working @ Pranos.AI as an embedded firmware software engineer. I'll be focusing on firmware optimization and systems connectivity. 

ðŸ”­ I'm also doing research with the BLISS Group, specifically looking at multi-item, multi-user markets and building recommender systems and algorithms under price allocations and constraints.
 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking Berkeley's ML Class, in addition to a Database Class

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge âš½ fan, and currently play club Soccer here at Cal<br>
