### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Current Work: <br>
This summer, I'll be working @ [DevRev](https://devrev.ai/about), focusing on NLP Tasks. I'm also researching with the BLISS Group Here at Berkeley, where I'm focusing on ML algorithms in multi-item, multi-user marketplaces operating under price and allocation constraints. Specifically, I'm working on building models that predict human behavior in these marketplaces using techniques like neural collaborative filtering and DLRM's.
